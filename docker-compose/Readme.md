## Docker-compose runtime files

This folder used to contain example `docker-compose.yml` files for various
languages. Instead you can now configure your own docker-compose file - on the
fly - using Weaviate's documentation.

configuration](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose).
