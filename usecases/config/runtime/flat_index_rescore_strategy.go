// The Flat index rescores against a dedicated vector store when PQ is used.
// This leads to a 2x write amplification of all vectors because they are
// already stored in the object store.

// could save a lot of space if we were to rescore against the object store.
// This might even have benefits due to (page) cache locality.
//
// The point of this temporary flag is to prove our hypothesis right or wrong.
