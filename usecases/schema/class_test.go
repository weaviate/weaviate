/// TODO-RAFT START
// Fix Unit Tests
// With class-related transactions refactored into class.go, we need to re-implement the following test cases:
// - Get schema (previously located in get_test.go)
// - Validation (previously located in validation_test.go)
// - Adding new classes (previously in add_test.go)
// - Updating existing classes (previously in update_test.go)
// - Restore classes once Restore is implemented (previously in restore_test.go)
// Please consult the previous implementation's test files for reference.
/// TODO-RAFT END
