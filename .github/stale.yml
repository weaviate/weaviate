  Thank you for your contribution to Weaviate. This issue has not received any 
  activity in a while and has therefore been marked as stale. Stale issues will
  eventually be autoclosed. This does not mean that we are ruling out to work 
  on this issue, but it most likely has not been prioritized high enough in the
  last months.
  
  If you believe that this issue should remain open, please leave a short reply.
  This lets us know that the issue is not abandoned and acts as a reminder for our
  team to consider prioritizing this again.

  Please also consider if you can make a contribution to help with the solution
  of this issue. If you are willing to contribute, but don't know where to start,
  please leave a quick message and we'll try to help you.

  Thank you,
  The Weaviate Team
