  weaviate-logs-fetch:
    description: "Fetches Weaviate server logs from the in-memory buffer with pagination support. Use this to debug issues, monitor server behavior, or understand what's happening in the Weaviate instance. Supports optional 'limit' (default 2000, max 50000 characters) and 'offset' (default 0 for most recent logs) parameters for pagination. To fetch older logs, increase the offset value."
