tools:
  weaviate-collections-get-config:
    description: "Retrieves the schema configuration for one or all collections in the Weaviate database. Use this to understand the structure, properties, and settings of your data collections before querying or inserting data."

  weaviate-tenants-list:
    description: "Lists all tenants for a specific multi-tenant collection. Use this to discover which tenants exist in a collection before performing tenant-scoped operations."

  weaviate-query-hybrid:
    description: "Performs a hybrid search combining vector similarity and keyword matching (BM25) on a collection. This is the primary search tool - use it to find relevant objects based on natural language queries. The alpha parameter controls the balance between semantic (vector) and keyword search. Supports optional filters to narrow down results based on property values using the same where filter syntax as weaviate-objects-delete."

  weaviate-collections-create:
    description: "Creates a new collection (class) in the Weaviate database. Use this to define the schema for a new data type with properties, vector configuration, inverted index settings, and multi-tenancy options. Essential for setting up your data structure before inserting objects."

  weaviate-objects-delete:
    description: "Deletes objects from a collection based on optional where filters. IMPORTANT: Defaults to dry_run=true for safety - returns count of objects that would be deleted without actually deleting them. Set dry_run=false to perform actual deletion. Supports Weaviate's where filter syntax to target specific objects (e.g., delete by status, date, or any property). Without a filter, deletes ALL objects in the collection. Use this to selectively remove objects or clear collection data."

  weaviate-objects-upsert:
    description: "Upserts (inserts or updates) one or more objects into a collection in batch. Supports efficient bulk operations - provide an array of objects to insert or update multiple objects at once. Each object can optionally specify a UUID; if provided and exists, the object is updated, otherwise a new object is created. Returns results for each object including success/failure status and generated UUIDs. Use this for adding or modifying data in Weaviate collections."

  weaviate-objects-get:
    description: "Retrieves one or more objects from a collection. Can fetch specific objects by providing an array of UUIDs, or retrieve a paginated list of all objects in the collection. Supports filtering which properties and metadata to return, and optionally including vectors. Use this to inspect stored data, verify insertions, or retrieve objects for processing."

  weaviate-logs-fetch:
    description: "Fetches Weaviate server logs from the in-memory buffer with pagination support. Use this to debug issues, monitor server behavior, or understand what's happening in the Weaviate instance. Supports optional 'limit' (default 2000, max 50000 characters) and 'offset' (default 0 for most recent logs) parameters for pagination. To fetch older logs, increase the offset value."
