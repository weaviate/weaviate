// Drain handles the graceful shutdown of all batch processing components.
//
// The order of operations needs to be as follows to ensure that there are no missed objects/references in any of the
// processing queue nor any missed errors in the reporting queues:
//
// 1. Stop accepting creation of new streams in the handlers
//   - This prevents new streams from being added to the system while we are shutting down
//
// 2. Wait for all in-process streams to be drained (i.e. all h.recv goroutines to complete)
//   - This ensures that the processing queue is no longer being written to
//
// 3. Stop the worker loops and drain the processing queue
//   - This ensures that all currently waiting batch requests in the processing queue are processed and any errors added to the reporting queues
//
// 4. Signal shutdown complete and wait for all streams to communicate this to clients
//   - This ensures that all clients have acknowledged shutdown so that they can successfully reconnect to another node
//
// The batching shutdown is then considered complete as every queue has been drained successfully so the server
// can move onto switching off the HTTP handlers and shutting itself down completely.
