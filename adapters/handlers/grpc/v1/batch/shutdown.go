// Drain handles the graceful shutdown of all batch processing components.
//
// The order of operations needs to be as follows to ensure that there are no missed objects/references in any of the
// write queues nor any missed errors in the read queues:
//
// 1. Stop accepting new requests in the handlers
//   - This prevents new requests from being added to the system while we are shutting down
//
// 2. Wait for all in-flight Send requests to finish
//   - This ensures that the write queues are no longer being written to
//
// 3. Stop the scheduler loop and drain the write queues
//   - This ensures that all currently waiting write objects/references are added to the internal queues
//
// 4. Stop the worker loops and drain the internal queue
//   - This ensures that all currently waiting batch requests in the internal queue are processed
//
// 5. Signal shutdown complete and wait for all streams to communicate this to clients
//   - This ensures that all clients have acknowledged shutdown so that they can successfully reconnect to another node
//
// The gRPC shutdown is then considered complete as every queue has been drained successfully so the server
// can move onto switching off the HTTP handlers and shutting itself down completely.
