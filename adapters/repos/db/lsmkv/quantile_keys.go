// QuantileKeys returns an approximation of the keys that make up the specified
// quantiles. This can be used to start parallel cursors at fairly evenly
// distributed positions in the segment.
//
// To understand the approximation, checkout
// [lsmkv.segmentindex.DiskTree.QuantileKeys] that runs on each segment.
//
// Some things to keep in mind:
//
//  1. It may return fewer keys than requested (including 0) if the segment
//     contains fewer entries
//  2. It may return keys that do not exist, for example because they are
//     tombstoned. This is acceptable, as a key does not have to exist to be used
//     as part of .Seek() in a cursor.
//  3. It will never return duplicates, to make sure all parallel cursors
//     return unique values.

// pickEvenlyDistributedKeys picks q keys from the input keys, trying to keep
// the distribution as even as possible. The input keys are assumed to be
// sorted. It never returns duplicates, see the unit test proving this.
//
// Important to keep in mind is that our input values do not contain the first
// and last elements, but rather the first quantile points.
// This is because they were obtained using
// [lsmkv.segmentindex.DiskTree.QuantileKeys] which traverses the binary tree
// to a certain depth. The first element in the list is the element you get
// from continuously following the left child until you hit the maximum
// traversal depth. Respectively, the last element is the element you get from
// continuously following the right child until you hit the maximum traversal
// depth.
// This means that when a cursor uses those keys, it will need to add two
// special cases:
//
//  1. It needs to start with the actual first element and read to the first
//     checkpoint
//  2. When reaching the last checkpoint, it needs to keep reading
//     until the cursor no longer returns elements.
//
// As a result our goal here is to keep the gaps as even as possible. For
// example, assume the keys ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"]
// and we want to pick 3 keys. We would return ["C", "F", "I"], thus keeping
// the spacing fairly even.
