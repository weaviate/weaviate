// Experiment with inlining and flattening the L2Squared distancer.
// Theoretically, this should be faster than the loop version for small vectors
// - it avoids the loop overhead
// - it eliminates the bounds check by reversing the iteration
// - it allows l22 and l24 to be inlined (the other ones are too large)
// See go tool compile -d=ssa/check_bce/debug=1 -m l2_inline.go
