// (i.e., the consumer is slow or blocked), the producer blocks while trying to send operations.
// While blocked, any additional ticks from the time.Ticker are dropped, as time.Ticker does not
// buffer ticks. This means the polling interval is effectively paused while the system is under load.

// to process it. Missing some ticks during backpressure is acceptable and avoids accumulating
// unprocessed work or overloading the system.
