## Overview

Weaviate is an **open source ‚Äãvector search engine** that is robust, scalable, cloud-native, and fast. 

If you just want to get started, great! Try:
- the [quickstart tutorial](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart) if you are looking to use Weaviate, or
- the [contributor guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/contributor-guide) if you are looking to contribute to the project.

And you can find our [documentation here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/).

If you have a bit more time, stick around and check out our summary below üòâ

## Why Weaviate?

With Weaviate, you can turn your text, images and more into a searchable vector database using state-of-the-art ML models.

Some of its highlights are:

### Speed

Weaviate typically performs a 10-NN neighbor search out of millions of objects in single-digit milliseconds. See [benchmarks](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/benchmarks).

### Flexibility

You can use Weaviate to conveniently **vectorize your data at import time**, or alternatively you can **upload your own vectors**. 

These vectorization options are enabled by Weaviate modules. Modules enable use of popular services and model hubs such as [OpenAI](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai), [Cohere](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-cohere) or [HuggingFace](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-huggingface) and much more, including use of local and custom models.

### Production-readiness

Weaviate is designed to take you from **rapid prototyping** all the way to **production at scale**. 

To this end, Weaviate is built with [scaling](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/cluster), [replication](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture), and [security](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/authentication) in mind, among others. 

### Beyond search

Weaviate is a search engine that is capable of much more. Some of its other superpowers include **recommendation**, **summarization**, and **integrations with neural search frameworks**.

## What can you build with Weaviate?

For starters, you can build vector search engines with text, images, or a combination of both. 

You can also build question and answer extraction, summarization and classification systems.

You can find [code examples here](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate-examples), and you might blog posts like these useful:

## Weaviate helps ...

1. **Software Engineers** ([docs](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/)) - Who use Weaviate as an ML-first database for your applications. 
    * Out-of-the-box modules for: NLP/semantic search, automatic classification and image similarity search.
    * Easy to integrate into your current architecture, with full CRUD support like you're used to from other OSS databases.
    * Cloud-native, distributed, runs well on Kubernetes and scales with your workloads.

2. **Data Engineers** ([docs](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/)) - Who use Weaviate as a vector database that is built up from the ground with ANN at its core, and with the same UX they love from Lucene-based search engines.
    * Weaviate has a modular setup that allows you to use your ML models inside Weaviate, but you can also use out-of-the-box ML models (e.g., SBERT, ResNet, fasttext, etc).
    * Weaviate takes care of the scalability, so that you don't have to.
    * Deploy and maintain ML models in production reliably and efficiently.

3. **Data Scientists** ([docs](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/)) - Who use Weaviate for a seamless handover of their Machine Learning models to MLOps.
    * Deploy and maintain your ML models in production reliably and efficiently.
    * Weaviate's modular design allows you to easily package any custom trained model you want.
    * Smooth and accelerated handover of your Machine Learning models to engineers.
