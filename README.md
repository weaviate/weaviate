## Overview

Weaviate is an **open source vector database** that is robust, scalable, cloud-native, and fast.

If you just want to get started, great! Try:

- the [quickstart tutorial](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart) if you are looking to use Weaviate, or
- the [contributor guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/contributor-guide) if you are looking to contribute to the project.

And you can find our [documentation here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/).

If you have a bit more time, stick around and check out our summary below üòâ

## Why Weaviate?

With Weaviate, you can turn your text, images and more into a searchable vector database using state-of-the-art ML models.

Some of its highlights are:

### Speed

Weaviate typically performs a 10-NN neighbor search out of millions of objects in single-digit milliseconds. See [benchmarks](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/benchmarks).

### Flexibility

You can use Weaviate to conveniently **vectorize your data at import time**, or alternatively you can **upload your own vectors**.

These vectorization options are enabled by Weaviate modules. Modules enable use of popular services and model hubs such as [OpenAI](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai), [Cohere](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-cohere) or [HuggingFace](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-huggingface) and much more, including use of local and custom models.

### Production-readiness

Weaviate is designed to take you from **rapid prototyping** all the way to **production at scale**.

To this end, Weaviate is built with [scaling](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/cluster), [replication](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture), and [security](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/authentication) in mind, among others.

### Beyond search

Weaviate powers lightning-fast vector searches, but it is capable of much more. Some of its other superpowers include **recommendation**, **summarization**, and **integrations with neural search frameworks**.

## What can you build with Weaviate?

For starters, you can build vector databases with text, images, or a combination of both.

You can also build question and answer extraction, summarization and classification systems.

You can see [project examples here](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials) or [quick notebook tutorials here](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes), and you might find these blog posts useful:
