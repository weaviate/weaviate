## Overview

Weaviate is a cloud-native, **open source vector database** that is robust, fast, and scalable.

To get started quickly, have a look at one of these pages:

- [Quickstart tutorial](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/quickstart) To see Weaviate in action
- [Contributor guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/contributor-guide) To contribute to this project

For more details, read through the summary on this page or see the system [documentation](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/).

## Why Weaviate?

Weaviate uses state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models to turn your data - text, images, and more - into a searchable vector database.

Here are some highlights.

### Speed

Weaviate is fast. The core engine can run a 10-NN nearest neighbor search on millions of objects in milliseconds. See [benchmarks](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/benchmarks).

### Flexibility

Weaviate can **vectorize your data at import time**. Or, if you have already vectorized your data, you can **upload your own vectors** instead.

Modules give you the flexibility to tune Weaviate for your needs. More than two dozen modules connect you to popular services and model hubs such as [OpenAI](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai), [Cohere](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-cohere), [VoyageAI](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-voyageai) and [HuggingFace](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-huggingface). Use custom modules to work with your own models or third party services.

### Production-readiness

Weaviate is built with [scaling](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/cluster), [replication](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/concepts/replication-architecture), and [security](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/authentication) in mind so you can go smoothly from **rapid prototyping** to **production at scale**.

### Beyond search

Weaviate doesn't just power lightning-fast vector searches. Other superpowers include **recommendation**, **summarization**, and **integration with neural search frameworks**.

## Who uses Weaviate?

- **Software Engineers**

  - Weaviate is an ML-first database engine
  - Out-of-the-box modules for AI-powered searches, automatic classification, and LLM integration
   - Full CRUD support
   - Cloud-native, distributed system that runs well on Kubernetes
   - Scales with your workloads

- **Data Engineers**

  - Weaviate is a fast, flexible vector database

   - Easily package custom trained models

## What can you build with Weaviate?

A Weaviate vector database can search text, images, or a combination of both. Fast vector search provides a foundation for chatbots, recommendation systems, summarizers, and classification systems.

Here are some examples that show how Weaviate integrates with other AI and ML tools:

### Use Weaviate with third part embeddings 

- [Cohere](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-cohere) ([blogpost](https://txt.cohere.com/embedding-archives-wikipedia/))

### Demos

These demos are working applications that highlight some of Weaviate's capabilities. Their source code is available on GitHub. 

- [Verba, the Golden RAGtreiver](https://verba.weaviate.io) ([GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate/verba))
- [Healthsearch](https://healthsearch.weaviate.io) ([GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate/healthsearch-demo))
- [Awesome-Moviate](https://awesome-moviate.weaviate.io/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials/awesome-moviate))

## How can you connect to Weaviate?

Weaviate exposes a [GraphQL API](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/graphql) and a [REST API](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/rest). Starting in v1.23, a new [gRPC API](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/grpc) provides even faster access to your data. 

Weaviate provides client libraries for several popular languages:

- [Python](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python)
- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript)
- [Go](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/go)
- [Java](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/java)

There are also [community supported libraries](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/community) for additional languages.

## Where can You learn more?

Free, self-paced courses in [Weaviate Academy](https://weaviate.io/developers/academy) teach you how to use Weaviate. The [Tutorials repo](https://github.com/weaviate-tutorials) has code for example projects. The [Recipes repo](https://github.com/weaviate/recipes) has even more project code to get you started.

The [Weaviate blog](https://weaviate.io/blog) and [podcast](https://weaviate.io/podcast) regularly post stories on Weaviate and AI.
