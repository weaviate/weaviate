**Weaviate** is an open-source, cloud-native vector database that stores both objects and vectors, enabling semantic search at scale. It combines vector similarity search with keyword filtering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reranking in a single query interface. Common use cases include RAG systems, semantic and image search, recommendation engines, chatbots, and content classification.

Weaviate supports two approaches to store vectors: automatic vectorization at import using [integrated models](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers) (OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, and others) or direct import of [pre-computed vector embeddings](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors). Production deployments benefit from built-in multi-tenancy, replication, RBAC authorization, and [many other features](#weaviate-features).

To get started quickly, have a look at one of these tutorials:

- [Quickstart - Weaviate Cloud](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/quickstart)
- [Quickstart - local Docker instance](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/quickstart/local)

## Installation

Weaviate offers multiple installation and deployment options:

- [Docker](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/docker-installation)
- [Kubernetes](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/k8s-installation)
- [Weaviate Cloud](https://console.weaviate.cloud)

See the [installation docs](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy) for more deployment options, such as [AWS](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/aws-marketplace) and [GCP](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/installation-guides/gcp-marketplace).

## Getting started

You can easily start Weaviate and a local vector embedding model with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
services:
  weaviate:
    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/weaviate:1.32.2
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "50051:50051"
    environment:
      ENABLE_MODULES: text2vec-model2vec
      MODEL2VEC_INFERENCE_API: http://text2vec-model2vec:8080

  # A lightweight embedding model that will generate vectors from objects during import
  text2vec-model2vec:
    image: cr.weaviate.io/semitechnologies/model2vec-inference:minishlab-potion-base-32M
```

Start Weaviate and the embedding service with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Install the Python client (or use another [client library](#client-libraries-and-apis)):

```bash
pip install -U weaviate-client
```

The following Python example shows how easy it is to populate a Weaviate database with data, create vector embeddings and perform semantic search:

```python
import weaviate
from weaviate.classes.config import Configure, DataType, Property

# Connect to Weaviate
client = weaviate.connect_to_local()

# Create a collection
client.collections.create(
    name="Article",
    properties=[Property(name="content", data_type=DataType.TEXT)],
    vector_config=Configure.Vectors.text2vec_model2vec(),  # Use a vectorizer to generate embeddings during import
    # vector_config=Configure.Vectors.self_provided()  # If you want to import your own pre-generated embeddings
)

# Insert objects and generate embeddings
articles = client.collections.get("Article")
articles.data.insert_many(
    [
        {"content": "Vector databases enable semantic search"},
        {"content": "Machine learning models generate embeddings"},
        {"content": "Weaviate supports hybrid search capabilities"},
    ]
)

# Perform semantic search
results = articles.query.near_text(query="Search objects by meaning", limit=1)
print(results.objects[0])

client.close()
```

This example uses the `Model2Vec` vectorizer, but you can choose any other [embedding model provider](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers) or [bring your own pre-generated vectors](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors).

## Client libraries and APIs

Weaviate provides client libraries for several programming languages:

- [Python](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/python)
- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/typescript)
- [Java](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/java)
- [Go](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/go)
- C# (üöß Coming soon üöß)

There are also additional [community-maintained libraries](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/client-libraries/community).

Weaviate exposes [REST API](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/rest), [gRPC API](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/grpc), and [GraphQL API](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/api/graphql) to communicate with the database server.

## Weaviate features

These features enable you to build AI-powered applications:

- **‚ö° Fast Search Performance**: Perform complex semantic [searches](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/similarity) over billions of vectors in milliseconds. Weaviate's architecture is built in Go for speed and reliability, ensuring your AI applications are highly responsive even under heavy load. See our [ANN benchmarks](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/benchmarks/ann) for more info.

- **üîå Flexible Vectorization**: Seamlessly vectorize data at import time with [integrated vectorizers](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/model-providers) from OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, Google, and more. Or you can import [your own vector embeddings](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/starter-guides/custom-vectors).

- **üîç Advanced Hybrid & Image Search**: Combine the power of semantic search with traditional [keyword (BM25) search](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/bm25), [image search](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/image) and [advanced filtering](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/filters) to get the best results with a single API call.

- **ü§ñ Integrated RAG & Reranking**: Go beyond simple retrieval with built-in [generative search (RAG)](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/generative) and [reranking](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/search/rerank) capabilities. Power sophisticated Q&A systems, chatbots, and summarizers directly from your database without additional tooling.

- **üìà Production-Ready & Scalable**: Weaviate is built for mission-critical applications. Go from rapid prototyping to production at scale with native support for [horizontal scaling](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/configuration/horizontal-scaling), [multi-tenancy](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/manage-collections/multi-tenancy), [replication](https://docs.weaviate.io/deploy/configuration/replication), and fine-grained [role-based access control (RBAC)](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/configuration/rbac).

- **üí∞ Cost-Efficient Operations**: Radically lower resource consumption and operational costs with built-in [vector compression](https://docs.weaviate.io/weaviate/configuration/compression). Vector quantization and multi-vector encoding reduce memory usage with minimal impact on search performance.
